# Final-Project

## Presentation

**Group Name:** Olympiads

**Topic:** Olympic Medal Predictor 

**Why This Topic:** The purpose of this project is to see what criteria will make a country more likely to win medals. We will be comparing country statistics such as population and GDP to see if this can impact the likelihood that a country will win more medals.

**Description of Data Source:** The three sources of data we will be utilizing is:
1. Gold Medalist Data from 1896 to 2020, such as name, country, height, weight, age, and year competed in the Olympic. This will be completed by merging the <a href="Resources/120 Years Of Olympic Data">1896 to 2016 Olympic data</a> with the more recent <a href="Resources/2021 Olympics">2020 Olympic</a>.
2. Country Data, such as <a href="Resources/World Population">population</a> and <a href="Resources/World GDP">GDP</a>
3. Event Data, such as event name and gold medalist name. This will be completed by creating a separate DataFrame from the <a href="Resources/120 Years Of Olympic Data">1896 to 2016 Olympic data</a> and <a href="Resources/2021 Olympics">2020 Olympic data</a>.

**Questions To Answer With The Data Source:** What criteria makes a country more likely to win medals?

## Machine Learning

Our Machine Learning model will focus on predicting how many medals a country will win based on a country's GDP and population.

The model will be a continous regressionn model.

## Database

After analyzing our data, our team created an <a href="Database/ERD.png">ERD Database Draft</a>. In this draft, it will showcase how our current datasets link together.
